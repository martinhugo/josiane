# josiane

Josiane is a multi agent simulation framework, which aims to provide tools to model real life industrial, transportation, and optimization problems using multi-agent approaches.

This tool aims to propose a simulation environment to develop and tests methods reducing the energetic consumption, carbon footprint, and in a wider perspective the environmental impacts of the studied problem.

Josiane is a new open source project, whose development is only starting and this README will evolve and be completed at each new release.
